Build a deep learning-based fire detection system for surveillance cameras. Include:
• A step-by-step guide to preparing the dataset.
• A custom model or use of a pre-trained model fine-tuned for fire detection.
• A script to deploy the model and simulate real-time fire detection with video streams.
